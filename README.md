Hotel Booking Analysis – Booking Patterns & Customer Behaviour
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking data to understand booking patterns, customer behavior, pricing, and stay trends.
The dashboard helps identify where bookings come from, who the customers are, how long they stay, and how pricing differs by hotel type, enabling better business and operational decisions.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze booking distribution across market segments and customer types

Understand length of stay patterns

Compare Average Daily Rate (ADR) between City and Resort hotels

Provide actionable insights to support pricing, marketing, and operations
